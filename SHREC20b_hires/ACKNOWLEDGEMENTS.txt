Note: Please respect the repective licenses of the models used in this dataset.

Modifications: All models have been minimally edited to alter the original model content (mesh simplification, ground plane removal, erroneous genus correction, hole filling, duplicate/unreference vertices/faces removal, non-manifold vertices/edges removal, scale/transform/rotate canonically).
